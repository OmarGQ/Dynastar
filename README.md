Generating new levels automatically might appeal to some as a lazy way to create 
endless content for a game. But when correctly applied, it can present an experience that will 
still feel fresh after hours of the game. This concept has been slowly introduced into video game 
development since the â€™80s, and nowadays it is more common than ever to find all sorts of 
procedural content in games. One of the motivations to use this procedural generation is the 
one-off finding new ways to make games repayable, either by generating new ways for games 
to be played or for generating content as the player plays. This way, a game can have more 
content than the one generated by the developers. However, many independent game developers see 
this as an easy way to create content and avoid designing complex levels, neglecting the quality 
of the generated content. Procedural generation is a powerful tool that requires attention to 
detail when implemented.

With this game, Dynastar, I present an accessible alternative for the generation of more complex 
procedural dungeons for Roguelike games. By combining different terrain and dungeon generation methods 
into a single algorithm, the generated levels are more complex while still conserving the characteristics 
of a dungeon crawler. But as this genre has an immense diversity of game mechanics, this approach will 
not work for every single dungeon crawler. But still, with some work, this approach could be adapted to 
generate levels with the structure the developer needs.

It is a challenge to generate random interesting environments to explore and ensure that 
the player will be able to beat all generated levels, but it is possible with the right tools. Perlin 
noise is the main algorithm that I will be using to archive this objective. As Minecraft has 
demonstrated, Perlin noise is a powerful generation algorithm that if it is correctly implemented  
can generate bast and interesting worlds to explore. But a difference from Minecraft, my 
PLG will generate finite two-dimensional dungeons. Perlin noise along other generation 
algorithms should be able to generate levels that would be complex enough to make exploration
interesting and avoid the generation of impossible-to-complete levels
